# <div align="center">A Simple Implementation of Faster RCNN</div>

## Introduction
This project is an implementation of Faster RCNN (based on Resnet50 or VGG16). In this experiment, we use the train data and validation data of VOC2007 as the training set, and use the test data of VOC2007 as validation set. When testing, we use the validation data of VOC2012.The Resnet50-based model has **mAP**=0.649, **mIOU**=0.609, and **acc**=0.806 on the testing set, and the VGG-based model has **mAP**=0.644, **mIOU**=0.643, and **acc**=0.821 on the testing set.

## Installation

**1.** Clone the FasterRCNN repository.

git clone [https://github.com/mskmei/MIDTERM-PROJECT-CV-2022Spring.git](https://github.com/mskmei/MIDTERM-PROJECT-CV-2022Spring.git)

**2.** Build a new environment with conda.
Our environment is a Linux system with CUDA version == 11.4.
```bash
conda create -n faster python==3.8
conda activate faster
```

**3.** Install the needed packages.
```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
pip install tensorflow
pip install opencv-python
cd FasterRCNN
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Dataset Preparation
 **1.** Download the training, validation, test data and VOCdevkit

	wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar
	wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar
	wget http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2007/VOCdevkit_08-Jun-2007.tar

**2.** Extract all of these tars into one directory named `VOCdevkit`

	tar xvf VOCtrainval_06-Nov-2007.tar
	tar xvf VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar
	tar xvf VOCdevkit_08-Jun-2007.tar

**3.** It should have this basic structure

  	$VOCdevkit/                           # development kit
  	$VOCdevkit/VOCcode/                   # VOC utility code
  	$VOCdevkit/VOC2007                    # image sets, annotations, etc.
  	# ... and several other directories ...

   
   
   
## Train
Before trainig the model, make sure you have changed the root_path in train.py.
Train the model with this line of command:
```bash
python train.py
```
The code is default to use GPU when training, predicting, and testing, so if you use CPU to train the model, use this line of command:
```bash
python train.py --cuda False
```
Besides, considering that our implementation has two backbone to choose, the default is Resnet50, so if you want to train the model with VGG as the backbone (with GPU), use this line of command:
```bash
python train.py --backbone vgg
```

## Test
Before testing the model, make sure you have changed the root_path in test.py.
Test the trained model with this line of command:
```bash
python test.py --weights --path-to/your trained model
```
The default model is our pretrained model **model_data/resnet50_faster.pth** with the Resnet50 as the backbone.

## Predict
Also, before predicting, change the root_path in predict.py.
You can use the image **FasterRCNN/img/street.jpg** to have a look of your trained model using
```bash
python predict.py --weights --path-to/your trained model --img --path-to/FasterRCNN/img/street.jpg
```
